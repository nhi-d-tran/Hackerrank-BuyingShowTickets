# Hackerrank-BuyingShowTickets

There are n people standing in line to buy show tickets. Due to high demand, the venue sells tickets according to the following rules:

The person at the head of the line can buy exactly one ticket and must then exit the line.

If a person needs to purchase additional tickets,they must re-enter the end of the line and wait to be sold their next ticket(assume exit and re-entry takes zero seconds).

Each ticket sale takes exactly one second.

We express initial line of n people as an array, tickets = [tickets0, tickets1 ... ticketsN-1], where tickets i denotes the number of tickets person i wishes to buy. If Jesse is standing at a position p in this line, find out how much time it would take for him to buy all tickets. Complete the waiting time function in the editor below. It has two parameters:

An array, tickets, of n positive integers describing initial sequence of people standing in line. Each tickets i describes number of tickets that a person waiting at initial place.

An integer p, denoting Jesse's position in tickets.
